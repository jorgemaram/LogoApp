## How to watch

First of all, you should `fork` or `clone` this repo. 

After that, you should go to your terminal and, in the project directory, you should run the following commands: 

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start

```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### View on screen

However, if you prefer go straight to your desktop, you should click on <https://logoapp.netlify.app/>.\
If you prefer check the responsive view for smartphones, you could click on that link on your smartphone or you should press `F12` on Google Chrome, click on `Toggle device toolbar` and select one of smartphone's views (I used iPhoneX's view).

If you cannot see properly, do not worry, just refresh the webpage and you will be able to find these changes!
